# Mappy

The map generator you didn't know you needed in your life. Starting new DnD campaign? Making the next best indie RPG 
game of 2018? Like staring at blue, brown, beige, and green for hours on end? Mappy is for you. It can produce 
high-resolution maps broken up into cells. You can tweak the parameters of the generation process yourself, or if 
you're ~~lazy and out of ideas~~ looking for some quick results, you can select a built-in profile. 

## Design

I used [Amit Patel's blog](http://simblob.blogspot.co.uk/2010/09/polygon-map-generation-part-1.html) to get some ideas, 
as well as Jason Gregory's 
[Game Engine Archiecture](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Engine-Architecture-Second-Jason-Gregory/dp/1466560010) 
for laying down the software fundamentals on the lower-level component for the program. 

## TOSAGE

This is the first in a series of programs that will be used to build **TOSAGE**: The Open-Source Approach to Gaming 
Experiences. Mappy is the application that will bootstrap some sort of shitty pre-alpha version of TOSAGE into 
existence. I have a rough roadmap of projects that I'll use to improve TOSAGE throughout 2018. The current goal is to 
have something similar to [OGRE](http://www.ogre3d.org/), but more of a game engine and less of a graphics engine 
oriented towards games.
